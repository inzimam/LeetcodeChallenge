public class NumberComplement {

    /*
    Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

    Example 1:

    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

    Example 2:

    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

    Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
